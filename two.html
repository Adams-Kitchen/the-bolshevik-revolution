                  Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev were the leaders of the United States and the Soviet Union, respectively, during the final years of the Cold War. 
                  Reagan and Gorbachev met several times to discuss arms control and other issues, and their relationship is credited with helping to end the Cold War. 
                  Reagan's influence on the Soviet Union is often cited as a factor in the collapse of the Soviet Union including his speech where he urged Gorbachev 
                  to "tear down this wall" in reference to the Berlin Wall dividing East and West Germany.
                  Additionally, Gorbachev's policies of glasnost and perestroika helped to bring about the end of the Soviet Union.
